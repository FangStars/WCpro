I am curious. Why I am here? There's some kind of magic effect my mind to look at the sky. It is blue. The sky is blue like a mirror, and I can look myself from it. But the sky hasn't answer my question. Why I am here?
My dad said, everyone has the value to alive. What is my value? I am standing with the sky. Is that my value? The sky tell me to look myself, to understand myself, and I will find the answer. Blue blue sky, with white cloud and warm wind. Quiet between the earth and Zeus. Everyone has to complete their mission from they reached the world until they leave. Ya, this the value is.
What is the mission? My mom said, complete those must to do. Those? Maybe she said about wash shoe or done my homework? I think so. My grandparents said, to fill in the new blood in to the social, to continue the life by having income, to together push our country up to a new level. 
They said, these are the value I alive and why I am standing here.
Not enough time to waste, but I am sure I am lazy to complete the mission everyone is doing. I like to travel, I like to walk around the city, I like to live in a town. Can these things be the reason to explain why I am here?
Nowadays, I don't look at the sky anymore. Everyone is looking to the sky, and completing the mission to show their value. I look forward to the ground, and also the trees. Green green forest, with some cute mammals. I most like to do what I want to do. To leave the place which having all stupid mission.I am curious about why I am here.

My dad says everyone has the value to live. What is my value? I am standing here looking at  the sky. The sky tells me to look inside myself, to understand myself, and I will find the answer.          Everyone has to complete their mission from they day they reached the world until they leave. This the value.
And what is the mission? My mom says you need complete those must to do. Those? Maybe she  is talking about washing shoes or doing homework? I think so. My grandparents say that you musthelp the development of our society. They say this is the value I live and why I am standing here.

 Less time to waste, but I am sure I am lazy to complete the mission everyone is doing. I like          traveling, I like walking around the city and I like living in a town. Can these things be the  reason why I am here?

 Nowadays, I don't look at the sky anymore. Everyone is looking at the sky, and completing the    mission to show their value. I look forward to the ground, and also the trees. I like doing what I     want to do to show my value. The spring is coming.I looked out,I can find some flowers are growing.The grass is green.Everywhere in spring is beautiful.I love spring.

Sometimes I walk on the garden.I can hear the songs from birds,they're excited,they make me relax.

I enjoy the spring.Because the air that after spring rain is clean.I can play with the rain,it likes fairy밃flies in the sky freely.

Do you relize the spring is coming?Do you see the tree growing?Do you hear the birds are singing?I lov-e the spring very much.I can go hiking  with my friends,I can ride bike on the road.I am running on th-e play-ground and breathing the fresh air.

I hug in spring.What about you?When people are not in the mood, they will become angry and when their families or friends talk to them, they will bring their bad mood, saying the bad words to the dearest person. It is not the wise choice for people let out their bad mood, because when they calm down, they will be very regretful for what they have done to their families and friends. Sometimes mean words are just like the sharp knives, stabbing into people몶s hearts. So when we get angry, we should learn to control our emotion. We are easily to say out the hurting words, which makes the one we love suffering. Even if we apologize, but the pain still exists, like the broken mirror which can몶t be fixed totally. So when we are angry, the best way to be silent and don몶t do stupid things.From Monday until Friday most people are busyworking or studying, but in the evenings and off weekends they are free to relax and enjoy themselves. Some watch television or go to the movies;others participate in sports.It depends on individual interests. There are many different ways to spend our spare time.

모모Almost everyone has some kind of hobby. It may be anything from collecting stamps to making model airplanes.Some hobbies are worth a lot of money; others are valuable only to their owners.

모모I know a man Who has a coin collection worth several thousand yuan. A short time ago he bought a rare ten-yuan piece worth 250 yuan. He was very happy about the purchase and thought the price was reasonable, on the other hand, my son collects match boxes. He has almost 600 of them but I doubt if they are wortfi any money. However, to my son they are extremely valuable. Nothing makes him happier than to find a new match-box for his collection.

모모That's what a hobby means, i guess. It is something we like to do in our spare time simply for the fun of. it. The value in money is not important, but the pleasure it gives us is.

Today when people talk about Red Cross Organization, they shake their heads and don몶t trust this organization. People react for it originated from about four years ago, at that time, a girl showed off her luxury in the public media, she told people that her father was a member of the Red Cross Organization. More and more people knew her, they thought they were cheated by the organization, the money they donated was not used in the right way. The incident has a great negative influence on the Red Cross Organization, people don몶t trust it any more, they are not willing to donate their money. As for me, I will not donate money to the organization, I choose to give money to the person who is in need of help, so the money won몶t be taken by others, make sure the person get the real money.Everybody wants to get wealth. In today몶s material world, making money or becoming wealthy symbolizes a person몶s success and capability. Many people make every effort, pay any price to attain greater wealth. With money, they can but nice, large apartments in nice neighborhood; with money, they can own stately luxury cars. Wealth seems with money. Wealth seems to bring all happiness in life.In my opinion, people cannot do anything without money, but money is not everything. What money will bring you depends on your personal belief and goal in life. If you are kind enough to help others, especially the poor, money is a good thing to you. With it, you can do much more for the benefit of people and your country, and it will to your own happiness.If you want money just for your own needs, you몶ll never be satisfied or happy. In a word, you should have money spent for more people, only then can money be the source of your happiness.
A hobby can be almost anything a person likes to do in his spare time. Hobbyists raise pets, build model ships, weave bas-kets, or carve soap figures and so on. In a word, hobbies offer en-joyment, friendship, knowledge and relaxation.

모모Then, what is my hobby? Well, what I like most is singing. I began to sing songs when I was very young. My uncle was studying in a college then, so he could sing lots of songs, and he taught me several songs. I showed great interests in the music then, for they were pleasing to ears and easy to sing. My uncle told me they were called pop songs.

모모When I grew up, my music teacher found that I had a good voice, so she sent me to the Children's Palace to study vocal mu-sic. From then on, I began my vocal music training. And then I knew there were several kinds of songs, like folk songs, pop songs and so on. What I had learned most was the songs for children. They were all simple ones but our teacher trained us very strictly. We practiced how to produce sound and how to make our expres-sion more natural and more pleasing. Those simple training didn't reduce my interest in singing at all and I won awards one after another in several kinds of competition. Actually I began to make up a dream of becoming a famous singer in the future.

모모As time went by, I came to realize that my dream wouldn't come true for there were strict conditions of being a singer. But I still took singing as my hobby since I found in music the interests which were lost in the exams. When I put all my emotion into singing a song, it gave me very good and very pleasant feelings, and a good chance to relax. Besides, it was a good way to learn things that couldn't be easily found in life.

모모Now as I'm saying goodbye to my childhood my voice has changed into a deep male voice, and therefore I can sing a lot of songs written for adults. I am often deeply moved, by the melody or by what the song writers said. I can feel that these words come from the bottom of their hearts: "All my best memories come back clearly to me. Some can even make me cry, just like before. It's yesterday once more. ""Heal the world, make it a place, for you and for me and the entire human race". When I sing these songs, tears well up in my eyes.

모모I love singing, and the most warm and fragrant thing in life, I assume, is sitting in the sunshine, listening-to the walkman and singing together with the singer.

모모So, this is my hobby, and I hope every one of us can enjoy his own hobby, en joy the simple, good things of life.Before the summer vocation coming , I expierence so much,Such as being a teacher ,holding ceremony for our graduate ,joinning cet 6,I recon that I am more and more mature and confidence.

Christmas Day-December 25-which celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ, the founder of the Christian religion, is the biggest and best-loved holiday in the Christian World.

모모According to the Bible, the holy book of Christians, God decided to allow his only son, Jesus Christ, to be born to a human mother and live on earth so that people could understand God better and learn to love God and each other more. "Christmas"- meaning "celebration of Christ "- honors the time when Jesus was born to a young Jewish woman Mary.

모모Mary was engaged to be married to Joseph, a carpenter, but before they came together, she was found to be with child. Because Joseph, her husband, was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.

모모But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."

모모Although the exact date of the birth of Jesus nearly 2,000 years ago is not known, the calendar on the supposed date divides all time into B.C. (Before Christ )and A.D. ( a Latin phrase, Anno Domini, "in the year of our Lord.") For the first 300 years, Jesus' birthday was celebrated on different dates. Finally, in the year 354, church leaders chose December 25 as his birthday.Summer holiday is coming.I am going to do many things that I want to do.
